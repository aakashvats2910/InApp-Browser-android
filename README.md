# InApp-Browser-android
This project is an open source project to add the functionality of the Browser in you Android app.
# Why to use this?
Since many of the app developers want to retain their users inside their application only also if they are doing some work based on web activities.
So, in order to overcome the complexity of making a Self web-browser or going to another web browser for web-based work you can use this dependency of InApp-Android-Browser
